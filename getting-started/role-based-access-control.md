# üë®‚Äçü¶± Role-Based Access Control

In this project,  we have implemented **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage user permissions and ensure that users only have access to the features relevant to their role. There are three primary roles:

* [**Customer**](role-based-access-control.md#id-1.-customer)
* [**Vendor**](role-based-access-control.md#id-2.-vendor)
* [**SuperAdmin**](role-based-access-control.md#id-3.-superadmin)

## Overview of Roles

### 1. Customer

**Description:** The **Customer** role represents regular users who can interact with the application but have limited access compared to vendors or administrators.\
\
**Permissions:**

* View products listing from different vendor
* Add to cart and wishlist
* Make orders
* Add multiple shipping address
* View Order history
* Make payment from esewa (for now)
* Update personal Profile and settings

\
**Actions:**

* Customers cannot manage other users.
* Customers do not have access to vendor-specific features or administrative tools.



### 2. Vendor

Permissions:
